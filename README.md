# Takia & Marcos

# What are you watching tonight application

1. Application built to recommend and search for movies using OMDB API.
2. Use of Ternary operators in search was a bit confusing.
3. Simple integration was key for the implementation of the project.
4. States was easier to understand after the initial build.
5. Adding components became easier as project continued.
6. API integration was key for whole application process.
